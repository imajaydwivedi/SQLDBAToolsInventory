How do I resolve git saying “Commit your changes or stash them before you can merge”?

You can't merge with local modifications. Git protects you from losing potentially important changes.

You have three options:

Commit the change using
git commit -m "My message"
Stash it.
Stashing acts as a stack, where you can push changes, and you pop them in reverse order.

To stash, type

git stash
Do the merge, and then pull the stash:

git stash pop
Discard the local changes
using git reset --hard
or git checkout -t -f remote/branch

Or: Discard local changes for a specific file
using git checkout filename
